# Summary
Life is complicated; understanding local politics should not be. With so many different sources providing information, it can be overwhelming to try and find unbiased content. This is a major deterrent to having well-informed, involved citizens. 

SeaPoll is a centralized, informative, data-driven website that compiles unbiased political (local and national) information from a variety of sources in a digestible and user-friendly format. Information regarding local and regional politicians, policies, upcoming forums, and elections are available with two viewing options: visitor or a customizable user profile.

- Home page
- Politicians Page
- Election Page
- Issues Page
